      <p>Next month, we've got processing scheduled for Tressy and Cedar. Tressy came to us in 2021 from a local farm that was reducing their herd. A year later, she had Cedar. We steered him ourselves at 4 months. That's an experience I won't forget. 
        I secured his halter to a post in the loafing shed. Then my youngest daughter and eldest son each grabbed a leg of that wiggly little guy. Now, it's time for the next chapter. They've been pasture raised all their lives. No grain. No confinement.
        They did teach us about keeping our fences tight. Got out once or twice. We'd like to offer shares in each of these guys. Our plan is to replace them with the next generation. If you'd like a quarter or half, please give Reid a shout at <a href="mailto:holler@a.hall.win">holler@a.hall.win</a>

      <p>Say welcome to our newest additions! This month we just got 24 new Delaware chicks to restart the layer flock. This heritage breed is dual purpose, meaning they provide pretty good egg production and also grow out to about 8-10 pounds.</p>
